    /// On Blu-ray discs, Dolby TrueHD streams contain a separate, independent embedded inner AC-3 (Dolby Digital) stream
    /// for players that don't support TrueHD.  In effect, a Blu-ray TrueHD track is really a FULL TrueHD stream + a separate FULL AC-3 stream.
    /// 
    /// DTS-HD tracks, on the other hand, contain a standard DTS core stream + the difference between the lossy DTS data and the lossless DTS-HD data.
    /// This means DTS-HD doesn't require an embedded stream because older players will simply decode the standard DTS core and ignore the extra HD data,
    /// whereas newer players will see the HD diff and combine it with the standard DTS core to recreate the full lossless DTS-HD recording.
    /// 
    /// FFmpeg counts TrueHD and its embedded AC-3 stream as two completely separate streams/tracks, which means we have to increment our
    /// track indexes whenever we encounter a TrueHD track to make sure our numbers match up with FFmpeg.
