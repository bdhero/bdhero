How to concatenate files: http://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki/How%20to%20concatenate%20(join%2C%20merge)%20media%20files#samecodec

Concat demuxer

The concat demuxer was added to ffmpeg 1.1 . You can read about it in the documentation.

Create a file "mylist.txt" with all the files you want to have concatenated in the following form ( Lines starting with a dash are ignored ) :

    # this is a comment
    file '/path/to/file1'
    file '/path/to/file2'
    file '/path/to/file3'

Note that these can be either relative or absolute paths. Then you can encode your files with:

    ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy output
