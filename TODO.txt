Features
========

[ ] Detection/auto-selection:
    [ ] "Rate" tracks/playlists based on "evidence" - confidence level that they are main feature
    [ ] Apply certain filters only AFTER main playlists have been determined
        - e.g., "4 possible main playlists, but only 1 has ChapterDb results" (The Expendables 2)
    [ ] Primary audio -OR- subtitle language
        [ ] Most common first audio track language (main movie playlists only)
        [ ] If no audio (e.g., silent film - NOSFERATU), use same algorithm w/ subtitles
    [ ] Select primary language tracks -AND- tracks w/ the user's preferred language (e.g., Pan's Labyrinth)
        [ ] Configurable via preferences
        [ ] Prompt user for preferred language on first run?
            [ ] Suggest languages from:
                - InstalledUICulture: en-US
                - CurrentCulture:     bs-Latn-BA
                - CurrentUICulture:   en-US

[ ] Add ChapterGrabber preferences for adding leading chapter numbers

    [ ] Re-configure tracks (change Cut, Language, selected tracks) -- (for updating output file name, MKV title, track title)

Mono
====

Critical
--------

1. Use Mono build of Ninject.dll
2. ICSharpCode.TextEditor.dll - Net20 NuGet package must be copied to Net40 folder
3. Newtonsoft.Json.dll not getting copied to BDHeroGUI/bin/Debug

Important
---------

2. Replace ffmpeg.exe and mkvmerge.exe with Mac versions

Meh
---

[ ] Remove Mono compile-time checks (via #if __MonoCS__) and use runtime checks instead: http://stackoverflow.com/a/329072/467582.  Don't compile w/ Xamarin Studio - only use Visual Studio.
