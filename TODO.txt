Bugs
====

[ ] Cancel first scan _AFTER_ BDInfoDiscReaderPlugin has ran, but _BEFORE_ the optional plugins complete:
    No items show up in the playlist or track ListViews, but the controls are enabled and "Disc Info" is populated.

[ ] CTRL + I doesn't work in TextEditorControls in FormMain

[ ] "Filter Playlists" and "Filter Tracks" settings no longer work

    V:\BD\Uncategorized\DECEPTION

[ ] FFmpeg: error messages (e.g., "Permission denied") do not get logged with -loglevel fatal

[ ] 500_DAYS_OF_SUMMER: bdmt_eng.xml title sanitized is blank: sanitization removes (... and everything after it, and BDMT title is (500) Days of Summer

[ ] Exception thrown in FileUtils.CreateDirectory() when user types in goofy output path
[ ] Time Remaining is jumpy, esp. > 80% complete.  Thread queue?

Features

Mono
====

Critical
--------

1. Use Mono build of Ninject.dll
2. ICSharpCode.TextEditor.dll - Net20 NuGet package must be copied to Net40 folder
3. Newtonsoft.Json.dll not getting copied to BDHeroGUI/bin/Debug

Important
---------

2. Replace ffmpeg.exe and mkvmerge.exe with Mac versions

Meh
---

[ ] Remove Mono compile-time checks (via #if __MonoCS__) and use runtime checks instead: http://stackoverflow.com/a/329072/467582.  Don't compile w/ Xamarin Studio - only use Visual Studio.
